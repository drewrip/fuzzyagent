Consider the following {language} function code:
```
{code_snippet}
```

Insert a comment on the first line of every block. For instance, insert a comment should be inserted in this if statement:
```
if condition:
    # [n0]
```

The comment should contain a unique identifier like such:
```
{comment_syntax} [n1]
```

Be as terse as possible but include everything from the original code provided. Give absolutely no explanation. Anything that is not code will be penalized.
