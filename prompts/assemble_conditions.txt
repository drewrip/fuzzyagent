Consider the following {language} function code:
```
{code_snippet}
```

List the control flow conditions that must be true to reach the comment at {code_point}. Provide this list as a JSON array like such:
```
[
    "condition1",
    "condition2",
    "condition3",
    ...
]
```


Give absolutely no explanation or commentary. Anything that is not code will be penalized. The only output given should be a JSON block.
